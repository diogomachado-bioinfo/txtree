        <h1>HTML-TM - About</h1>

        <p>HTML-TM (HyperText Markup Language for Text Mining) is a tool designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of large text datasets. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for navigating through words, documents, and their relationships within the corpus. Below, the key components and functionalities of the HTML-TM tool are described.</p>

        <h2>Key Components of HTML-TM</h2>

        <h3>1. WORDS.html</h3>
        <p>The WORDS.html file serves as the primary entry point for exploring words within the dataset. It contains a structured table with the following columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>#:</strong> The index number of the word in the dataset, providing a unique identifier for each entry.</li>
            <li><strong>Word:</strong> The specific word from the dataset being analyzed.</li>
            <li><strong>Occ.:</strong> The number of occurrences of the word across documents, indicating how many documents contain the word.</li>
            <li><strong>Related Words:</strong> A list of the top 10 words most closely related to the target word, based on cosine similarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Related Doc.:</strong> A link to a separate page listing documents (papers) most closely associated with the word, based on cosine similarity. For more details about this page, see the "Related Documents Page" section below.</li>
            <li><strong>Word Tree:</strong> A hierarchical visualization of the 30 most related terms for the word, providing a structured overview of semantic connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Year Plot:</strong> A graphical representation of the word's usage over time, helping users identify trends and patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. TEXTS.html</h3>
        <p>The TEXTS.html file is designed for exploring documents within the corpus. It includes a table with the following columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>#:</strong> The index number of the document in the dataset, serving as a unique identifier.</li>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> The title of the document (paper), providing a quick reference to its content.</li>
            <li><strong>Year:</strong> The publication year of the document.</li>
            <li><strong>Related Doc.:</strong> A link to a separate page listing documents most similar to the current one, based on cosine similarity. For more details about this page, see the "Related Documents Page" section below.</li>
            <li><strong>PMID:</strong> The PubMed ID of the related document, linked to its corresponding page on PubMed for easy access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Related Documents Page</h3>
        <p>Both WORDS.html and TEXTS.html direct users to a <strong>Related Documents</strong> page when clicking on the "Related Doc." link. This page contains a table with the following columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>#:</strong> The index number of the related document.</li>
            <li><strong>Rank:</strong> The ranking of the document based on its similarity score to the target word or document.</li>
            <li><strong>Similarity:</strong> A numerical score indicating the degree of similarity between the target and the related document, calculated using cosine similarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Title + Abs.:</strong> The title of the related document, accompanied by its full abstract.</li>
            <li><strong>Year:</strong> The publication year of the document.</li>
            <li><strong>PMID:</strong> The PubMed ID of the related document, linked to its corresponding page on PubMed for easy access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Search Functionality</h2>
        <p>HTML-TM provides a table search tool that allows users to filter rows using complex queries, including logical operators (AND/OR), column-specific searches, and regular expressions. Detailed information can be accessed via the Help button located next to the search button on the WORDS.html and TEXTS.html pages.</p>
